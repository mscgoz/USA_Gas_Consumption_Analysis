# Natural Gas Consumption Analysis of United States of America

## 1. Introduction

This project explores detailed analysis of natural gas usage trends across U.S. states and consumption types. It may help energy analysts, policy makers, and utility planners understand:

- Seasonal demand shifts
- Sectoral comparison (e.g., residential vs commercial use)

The data includes:
- A total of **37,994 natural gas consumption records**
- Data is collected between 2014 and 2024

This dataset offers a robust foundation for analyzing trends in natural gas consumption in US over time.

This dataset was originally compiled by [@aking526](https://github.com/aking526) who:

1. Queried the relevant API between January 2014 and January 2024  
2. Converted the retrieved JSON data into annual CSV files  
3. Merged all years into a single CSV file  
4. Cleaned and adjusted some columns for usability

I am using the processed dataset as a base for exploratory analysis. Full credit to the original compiler. üôè
